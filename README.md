# Weather app

https://weather-app-dunicn.vercel.app/

This is a simple weather app created as a part of code test. Default temperature information is for Oslo, with search option for cities. I've used react query, chart.js, 
react-chartjs-2 and styled components for this app. 

## Plans for further development 

- better error handling
- adding a card with additional information about that day (humidity, feels like temperature, sunrise and sunset)
- enabling selection for multiple days, or one specific day
- mobile-first approach 

### Run Locally

  git clone https://github.com/dunicn/weather-app
  Go to the project directory

  cd weather-app

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
